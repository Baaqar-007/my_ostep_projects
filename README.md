# My OSTEP Projects

This repository contains my projects for the Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) course.

## Initial Utilities

The `initial_utilities` folder contains the following utilities:

- `wcat`: A basic utility for concatenating and printing files.
- `wgrep`: A utility for searching text within files.
- `wzip`: A utility for compressing files.
- `wunzip`: A utility for decompressing files.

## Usage

Each utility can be run from the command line. For example, to use `wcat`, navigate to the `initial_utilities` directory and run:

```bash
./wcat filename
```
